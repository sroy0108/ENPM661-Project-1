ENPM661: Planning for Autonomous Robots 
Project 1 : 8 Puzzle 

Problem statement:
To find all the possible states of the 8-Puzzle starting from the given initial state to the defined goal state using Brute Force Algorithm.

Steps to follow to run the code:
1. Import the main.py and functions.py files in any Python IDE.
2. Run the main.py file.
3. Enter the puzzle configuration with space between each number. The blank title is to be denoted by '0'.
4. The program will first check if the the configuration is solvable or not.
5. If the configuration is solvable, then the puzzle will be solved to reach the goal state.
6. The files nodePath.txt, NodesInfo.txt and Nodes.txt will store the output after the problem has completely run.
